<h2>Working With Cryptocurrencies(Virtual Currencies)</h2>

What Is A Cryptocurrency?

<p>A cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency created and held electronically and is securely designed. The origin of most cryptocurrencies is anonymous but it is believed their creation was influenced by the changing technological advancements and thus their creation to cater for specific markets and needs.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are mostly associated with the digital world that uses Cryptography,a technique of secret writing and coding to track down sales and digital transfers.</p>

<p>The origin of Cryptography is dated back to the Second world war developed to enhance and secure communication among war veterans. With time,Cryptography techniques has evolved with the improvement and advancement in technology aided by computer and data scientists to provide safe and secure communication paths,storage of data or information and protecting money online.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that bitcoin,the most expensive of all the cryptocurrencies was created in the year 2009 by a developer,Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi was motivated by the fact that he saw certain challenges with the conventional currencies and thus the need to address the problems by creating a new payment system in the name of bitcoins.</p>

<p>Creation of bitcoins by Nakamoto was made possible through the use of blockchain technology. Originally,blockchain technology was developed to be Open source meaning anyone in the world would be able to access it and use it to come up with improvements for development purposes.</p>

<p>It is very important not to mix up Blockchain and Bitcoin. Blockchain is a general terminology for a distributed digital ledger that can record transactions in such a way it provides a safe and secure uncrackable environment.</p>

<p>In summary,the easiest way to understand Bitcoins and the concept behind its rapid growth over the years is thinking about the normal currency such as the US Dollar,Euro,Pound e.t.c. Their rates goes up and down each and every day depending on what is happening in the world. Bitcoin is the same since its value goes up and down but rather than being influenced by events,bitcoin is based on people. Many countries in the world are embracing its use and many people accepting it as a mode of payment,most notably from the beginning of the year 2017 and thus by the end of November 2017,bitcoin rates had soared to a record value of over $10,000(Ten thousand US Dollars).</p>

<h5>2. Ethereum(Ether)</h5>

<p>With bitcoin as the most expensive and popular cryptocurrency trading at over $10,000(US Dollars),Ethereum comes up in tow as the second most expensive and popular cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>It has quickly risen to attain the position of the second largest and popular cryptocurrency within a short time,slightly over two years.</p>

<p>Ethereum was created by a 19-year old bitcoin developer by the name Vitalik Butering in the year 2013. It was officially launched in the year 2015,meaning it has actively traded in the market for a short period,slightly over 2 years. In the year 2017,Ethereum skyrocketed in both its value and popularity within a few months of active trading and circulation making it come second after the dominant,more expensive and lucrative bitcoin.</p>

<p>Ethereum cryptocurrency was created through ethereum blockchain technology and at the end of last month,November 2017,its market value had reached slightly over $460(US Dollars) with its value expected to grow rapidly in the coming months.</p>
